# BHKInterior.com - Product Whitepaper

## 1. Executive Summary
BHKInterior.com is an AI-native interior design platform that democratizes luxury home design. By combining Generative AI (Gemini) with procedural 3D rendering (Three.js), we allow homeowners to visualize renovations in seconds rather than weeks. Unlike competitors who offer static images, we offer an interactive design workflow that includes floor plan analysis, layout optimization, and 3D walkthroughs.

## 2. The Problem
The traditional interior design industry is broken for the average homeowner:
1.  **High Cost**: Professional designers charge $2,000 - $10,000+ per project.
2.  **Slow Turnaround**: Rendering and iterations take weeks.
3.  **Visualization Gap**: Clients struggle to understand 2D floor plans or mood boards.
4.  **Existing Tool Complexity**: DIY software (SketchUp, AutoCAD) has a steep learning curve; existing AI apps often just "reskin" photos without understanding scale or geometry.

## 3. The Solution: Intelligent Design Automation
BHKInterior.com solves this via a 3-step automated pipeline:

### Step 1: Contextual Understanding
We don't just look at pixels; we understand the *space*.
-   **Input**: Floor plans, video tours, or messy room photos.
-   **AI Analysis**: Our engine identifies walls, windows, architectural flow, and lighting conditions.
-   **Regional Nuance**: The system is location-aware. It suggests "Vaastu" compliant layouts for Indian users or "Open Concept" flows for North American users.

### Step 2: Generative Design & Layout
-   **Style Transfer**: Users choose from 45+ curated styles (e.g., Japandi, Modern Farmhouse).
-   **Intelligent Layouts**: The AI places furniture logically (not just visually) using collision detection and walkway analysis.
-   **Drag-and-Drop Editor**: Users can intervene and tweak the AI's furniture placement before final rendering.

### Step 3: Multimodal Output
-   **8K Photorealism**: High-fidelity renders for visual impact.
-   **3D Ultra Mode**: A lightweight, interactive 3D scene (GLB/Three.js) allowing users to pan, zoom, and rotate their new room layout.
